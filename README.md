# Gesture_Driven_Robotic_Control_System_with_RISCDUINO_board_Integration
The primary action or feature of the "Gesture-Driven Robotic Control System with RISCDUINO Integration" is "Control and Navigation through Gestures." This means that the product allows users to control the robot's movement and actions using hand gestures, providing an intuitive and interactive way to guide the robot's behaviour.

The algorithm breakdown of the Gesture-Driven Robotic Control System with
RISCDUINO board Integration:

Initialize the System
   - Power on the robotic system.
   - Initialize all sensors and components.

Gesture Recognition
   - Continuously capture input from the gesture sensor.
   - Process the captured gesture data.

Gesture Interpretation
   - Interpret the gesture data to recognize specific commands.
   - Translate gestures into actionable commands such as "move forward," "turn
left," "turn right," "stop," and others.

RISCDUINO Integration
   - Communicate with the RISCDUINO board to execute the recognized
commands.
   - Send appropriate control signals to the robotic actuators based on the
interpreted gestures.

Robot Movement Control
   - Execute the appropriate movement commands received from the RISCDUINO.
   - Control motor speed, direction, and duration to achieve desired movement.

Feedback and Status
   - Provide feedback on the robot's status and actions.
   - Display information such as current direction, speed, and gesture recognition
feedback if applicable.

User Interaction
   - Continuously wait for new gestures from the user.
   - Repeat the gesture recognition and execution loop.

Shutdown 
   - When the user decides to stop the robot or the system detects a shutdown
gesture:
     - Stop all motor movements.
     - Power down the system components.
